# Light Sensor Simulation

This is a C-based simulation project that mimics light sensor readings and processes them for analysis.

## Features
- Simulate light sensor data
- Read from CSV input
- Calculate statistics like average, max, trend
- Display output via console

## How to Run

```bash
gcc main.c sensor.c -o sensor_sim
./sensor_sim data/sensor_data.csv
